# Diabetes Detection Algorithm README

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script for diabetes detection using machine learning. The algorithm employs Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on health-related features. The program includes visualization of a confusion matrix, classification report, and a decision tree.

## Files

- **diabetes_detection.py:** Python script containing the implementation of the diabetes detection algorithm.
- **diabetes_PIMA_preprocessed.csv:** Preprocessed dataset used for training and testing the models.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

##Usage

-Run the Algorithm:
-Execute the diabetes_detection.py script to train the models and make predictions.

##Customization:
       -Modify the algorithm as needed by adjusting hyperparameters, choosing different models, or exploring additional preprocessing steps.

  ##Visualizations:
        -The script includes visualizations of the confusion matrix, classification report, and a decision tree for better interpretability.

##Dataset

    -The dataset is sourced from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, containing health-related information of individuals.

##Acknowledgments

    -This algorithm is developed for the task of diabetes detection, with inspiration from the need for effective machine learning-based healthcare solutions.
